## Tasks Performed ‚öôÔ∏è

### Data Preprocessing:

- **Data Loading:** The system loads the dataset containing information about individuals and their investment behavior.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values are identified and handled using techniques like imputation or removal based on the context.
- **Data Cleaning:** Duplicates are removed, data types are corrected, and consistency is ensured in categorical variables.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Visualization:

- **Data Exploration:** Visualizations are used to analyze demographic distribution, employment details, investment behavior insights, and investment outcomes. Performed many visualizations and found all the relationships among the features.

### Best Investment Decision Identification:

- **Analyzing Correlation:** Performed correlation among the features to find the feature which is highly correlated.
- **Baseline Model:** Trained initial models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks to establish a performance benchmark.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the baseline model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Underfitting was observed, so models were re-performed to improve accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used grid search or randomized search techniques to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared different models including Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods based on evaluation metrics. Random Forest was chosen as the best model for investment decision recommendation due to higher accuracy.

### User Interface:

- **Streamlit Interface:** Utilized Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for exploring data, visualizations, model inferences, and predictions. Created pages for About, Visualization, Inference, Prediction, and Analysis.
- **Example Prediction:** Provided an example of user input for predicting the best investment decision.

### PowerBI Dashboard:

- **Dashboard Integration:** Integrated Power BI dashboards into the system to provide interactive and insightful visualizations. Analyzed gender distribution, city distribution, return earned distribution, knowledge about investment, and household income.

## Conclusion

The Investment Decision Recommendation System leverages data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, visualization, user interface, and Power BI analysis to assist users in making better investment decisions. The systematic approach ensures reliability, accuracy, and user-friendliness throughout the system.
